    <h2>Phase 0: Requirements Specification (20%)</h2>
    <p>
       The purpose of this project is to teach me how to use Vue.js and how it is better than plain Vanilla.js. Using
        Vue.js, I must create a weather app that displays the user's IP address and location, the current conditions
        at that location, and a 5 day 3-hour weather forecast.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>IP Address fetch<p> This fetch uses the user's IP address to fetch there location data, which in turn can be
            plugged into the next fetch.</p></li>

        <li>The current weather fetch request<p>This fetch request goes to a different API endpoint that gets all the
            relevant data for today's weather.</p></li>
        <li>The weather forecast fetch request.<p>This fetch request goes to a different API endpoint that gets all the
            relevant data for the next 5 day's worth of weather, in 3-hour increments.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Problem this program aims to solve:</h3>
    <p>This program aims to teach me about fetch request chaining in Vue.js, which is a powerful way to use mulitple
        API endpoints in a time-dependant fashion.</p>
    <h3>Data used by this program:</h3>
    <p>This program utilizes the Vue.js framework, which encapsulate more methods than I
        can name or count accurately. It also uses 3 API endpoints listed above.
    </p>
    <h3>Algorithms and Formula:</h3>
    <p>No true formulation is required in this project aside from v-if-else blocks and fetch requests. </p>

    <h2>Phase 1: Design (30%)</h2>

    <pre><code>
        static.css:

                All css given in the assignment description by Erik Falor

        index.html:

                html document that contains html structure for 3 sections: an IP grabber, current weather, and forecast weather.

                Vue.js app structure with the following data:
                                                                post, which contains all info from IP address fetch request
                                                                current, which contains all info from current weather fetch request
                                                                forecast, which contains all info from forecast fetch request

                        created():
                                    each fetch request is contained here. First, request IP
                                    then, if IP is fetched successfully, request current and forecast asynchronously
                                    because both current and forecast are fetched in a then statement of the IP fetch,
                                    they will depend on data from IP and not be completed until they have that data.

                        methods:
                                forecastToggle():
                                    Gets the current div and changes it's color depending on how many times it's clicked.
    </code></pre>

<div class="Implementation">
    <h2>Phase 2: Implementation (10%)</h2>
    <ol>Roadblocks:
        <li> Vue is a very powerful app. I ran into trouble when I initially implemented the forecast fetch in the 'updated()'
            lifecycle hook. This caused the page to request forecast data every millisecond, which quickly burned my request limit.
        </li>
        <li>
            I had to figure out how to pass a json object from a request into the data() field of the Vue app. This caused
            some formational changes over time in my app from semi-hardcoded values to just passing the json object directly.
        </li>
        <li>
             I needed to learn how to chain fetch requests together.  This was intimidating at first, but proved simple in
            implementation.
        </li>
    </ol>
</div>

<div class="Testing">
<h2>Phase 3: Testing and Debugging (30%)</h2>
    <ol>Errors that needed fixing:
        <li>API was fetching every millisecond. Fixed by chaining fetch requests in the created() block rather than the updated() block.</li>
        <li>Errors were not displaying correctly when the network was failing. Fixed by creating data() attributes that hold boolean values for successful fetch requests.</li>
        <li>The text for each forecast object was quite small. Fixed by doing some not-so-creative styling.</li>
    </ol>
</div>

<div class="Deployment">
    <h2>Phase 4: Deployment (5%)</h2>
    <p>Done and done.</p>
</div>

<div class="Maintenance">
    <h2>Phase 5: Maintenance (N/A)</h2>
    <p>This code should last at least until HTTP or Vue get major language-specific changes. All the documentation
        for this project is here and easily readable. Vue is a funny creature. It contains a lot of code that does
        things without the user knowing it. For that reason I am tentative to say that this is a secure and robust program.
        If I understood Django in its entirety, including all security risks and pitfalls, then I would be able to fortify
        this project more thoroughly. </p>
